/* Notes
A value is a piece of data. It is the most fundamental unit of information that we  have in programming.

Naming Variables .
variable names cannot start with a number 
variable names can only contain numbers , letters, underscores or the dolllar sign.
Always write your variables with camel casing.
Don't use reserved keywords as variable name e.g(name)
Don't start a variable name with an Uppercase letter
write constants with upper case later
Make sure your variable names are descriptive(EASY TO UNDERSTAND).
Do this:
let myFirstJob = "Programmer";
let mySecondJob = "Teacher";

Don't do this
job1 = "Teacher";
job2 = "programmer";
